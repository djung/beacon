            <h3>Recommended Reading: The Thrive Diet</h3>
            <img src="images/blog/The-Thrive-Diet.jpg" align="left">
            <p>The Thrive Diet by Brendan Brazier is a great resource for those who are interested in maintaining an athletic life style with intense physical training, while adopting a plant based diet. The author focuses on limiting and reducing stress on the body. Thus, freeing up the bodies energy to work on areas requiring repair. My husband strictly followed this book for over a year and he loved it. He was able to workout for longer. His recovery time was dramatically reduced. I watched him noticeably reversed the aging process. At the age of 34 he looked better then when he was 24 serving in the Marines. The portion sizes in the recipes is not accurate for most people. My husband always ended up with more food than he could finish. The author probably trains 4 to 6 hours a day and needs to consume a large amount of calories. Another thing to look for is, he uses a lot of specialty foods that can be hard to find and really expensive. For example, some of the recipes call for hemp seed oil, when flax seed oil is cheaper and just as good for you. Do your homework on possible substitutions so you don’t break the bank and this book is amazing.</p>

            <h3>Recommended Reading: The Gerson Therapy</h3>
            <img src="images/blog/the-gerson-therapy.jpg" align="left">
            <p>The Gerson Therapy: The Proven Nutritional Program for Cancer and Other Illnesses By Charlotte Gerson and Morton Walker D.P.M. is another one of my personal favorites. Altho this book geared toward the severely ill, there is something everyone can use in it. Personally, I loved the fact that it gave such a clear understanding of why we get sick and how the body heals it’s self. Dr. Max Gerson defiantly understood there is no such thing as selective healing. By treating the body’s system as a whole, he was able to cure many illnesses. I personally was able to use this book when treating my own chronic illness. It worked wonders for me. I suffered for four years and was able to fix myself in three months. After gaining more of an understanding about nutrition and how the body heals, I changed my life style and adopted a plant based diet. I have not had a problem since. In todays world everyone is looking for that magic pill, when all it dose is treat the symptoms. They never really fix your body and the issues its having.</p>
